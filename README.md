HMS Time
========

Ahoy! All aboard the HMS Time! Got a lot of seconds you want converted into H:MM:SS.SSS (hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds).

Works especially well with the Web Audio API.

Usage
-----
```javascript
var hmsTime = require('./index.js');

console.log(hmsTime(9059.1)); // spits out '2:30:59.100'
```
